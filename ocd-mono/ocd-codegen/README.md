# Auto Generated OCD TypeScript (.ts) and React Typescript (.tsx) files

The OCD React package contains a number of Auto Generated files built from the Providers Terraform Schema file.
These generated files will not be stored within the repository and hence will need to be generated when the
repository is cloned / built.

To Generate these files the user must execute the following commands within the **codegen** directory.

```bash
npm install
npm run import-and-generate 
```
